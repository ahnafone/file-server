# File Server

File Server program using Node.js, Express, and EJS. Allows the PC running the server to host files that can be viewed or downloaded by other computers connected in the same network.

This program can be used to reuse old computers that are gathering dust as network file storage devices.

Currently, the program only supports reading files from storage.
